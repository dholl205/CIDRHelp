# CIDRHelp
This project taught me more about python than I knew when I started.
It was a project to help a company that I was job shadowing. They taught me about using python with security and that there is almost always an api for what you
are generally looking for.</br></br>
I was stuck on how to write json format from python using a list of lists. In the end I realized that it was a list of dictionaries, so I converted each list in a list 
into a dictionary, appended them to a list, and used json.dump to write to a json file.</br></br>
All in all this project was fun and a learning experience.
